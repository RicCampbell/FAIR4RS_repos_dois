title: Setup Required for the lesson
---

It's probably a good idea that we have them bring along a dataset/repository in github that they can mess around with.

We could run them through getting a DOI and all the other things and stuff.

OR

We could have a standard one that they work with, which would be linked below!

## Data Sets

<!--
FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.
       
Have created the folder 'data' under episodes in case we do want to provide a test/example dataset for use
-->
Download the [data zip file](https://example.com/FIXME) and unzip it to your Desktop

## Software Setup

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

### Details

Setup for different systems can be presented in dropdown menus via a `spoiler`
tag. They will join to this discussion block, so you can give a general overview
of the software used in this lesson here and fill out the individual operating
systems (and potentially add more, e.g. online setup) in the solutions blocks.
