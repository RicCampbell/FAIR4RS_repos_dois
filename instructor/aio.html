<p>The code that you write is important. No matter the size, style, or
language it is an integral part of the research that it is part of, or
of course sometimes it is the main output of the research project.</p>
<p>Historically research outputs have been focused on papers, and while
this is still mostly true, there has been a change in recent years to
give better acknowledgement to other research outputs, such as code.
There has also been a shift (which we are continuing to see) that
funders are requiring other outputs from projects to be made available,
and while this is mostly focused on the data that has been collected or
used, in certain fields code is also part of this. You may also come
across conferences or awards that require code to be available (and
open) to be able to submit or be considered. There’s also been a rich
history of code being made free and available to other.</p>
<p>Regardless of the reason you want to disseminate your code, there are
some ways you can make this easier for both your and anyone who wishes
to use you code, such as DOI’s, using repositories, metadata, and
knowing how to cite yourself.</p>

<p>A DOI is a type of PID. A PID is a Persistent Identifier, and a DOI
is a Digital Object Identifier. A single DOI is a linked to a digital
object and always directs to that object, regardless of the location or
potential changes to metadata. The most common use of DOIs is for
journal articles. A single article should have a single DOI, but they
can also be used for databases or software/code.</p>

<p>You’ve probably seen these many times before because, like that one,
they are used for journal articles. Interestingly, the article that
links to is about a tool that has been created, is freely available, has
a licence applied to it, but has no link to the <a href="https://github.com/astrom-tom/SPARTAN" class="external-link">code/software

<p>No. The internet as a whole is much more fragile than most people
think. There is a myriad of different ways that things break or cease to
exist. While there are of course some old webpages that are still up for
no apparent reason, and multiple archives and projects that try and
capture parts of the internet (<a href="https://web.archive.org/" class="external-link">Wayback Machine</a>, <a href="https://www.softwareheritage.org/" class="external-link">Software Heritage</a>), these
are by no means complete.</p>
<p>But speaking of your own code, if it’s on a webpage (maybe your own),
hosting isn’t free are you planning on keeping this webpage for a long
time? Are you never moving it from that page/URL, do you know if other
people are using that link?</p>

<p>A DOI essentially makes it someone else’s job to ensure that the

<p>Only registered organisations can created DOI’s. To be able to mint a
DOI, an organisation must meet the International DOI Foundations
standards and pay to become a member, meaning that they must have the
ability to ensure the DOIs are maintained.</p>
<p>They are also designed to be short and human readable, again unlike
most URLs. Whereas shortened URLs are not persistent.</p>

<p>Version control of course very important around code (see Version
control part of the FAIR4RS training), and you shouldn’t create more
than one DOI for a single digital object, however you can version with
DOIs;</p>

<p>That part at the end indicates which version the doi will resolve to.
If you have written some code for a research project, and the current
version is the one that was used, but you are still developing it,
referencing that version in any paper or outputs will allow people to
see exactly what the code looked like at the time the research was
conducted.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that if no version suffix is included in the
DOI link then it will resolve to the most recent version of the object.
This is sometimes exactly what is wanted and sometimes not, so it’s good
to think about this when using a DOI.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>To get a DOI for code the best place is to use a repository. It’s
important to note that (currently) GitHub does not mint DOIs. Some
examples of repositories that do are <a href="https://about.zenodo.org" class="external-link">Zenodo</a> and the University’s
institutional repository <a href="https://orda.shef.ac.uk" class="external-link">ORDA</a>.</p>
<p>When you make a deposit in a repository that does mint DOIs, there

<p>Hosting large amounts of data, minting DOIs, creating a usable
interface for code and ability to pull the code to other work setups all
take a lot of time and effort. This is where repositories comes in. A
repository will make space available to you to deposit your work.
GitHub, as a whole, could be seen as a repository, although you create
repositories yourself inside GitHub. It also does a lot more than just
hold your data/code, and of course it’s main function is version
control.</p>
<p>In the last episode we saw some repositories <a href="https://about.zenodo.org" class="external-link">Zenodo</a> and the University’s
institutional repository <a href="https://orda.shef.ac.uk" class="external-link">ORDA</a>, but
there are many more out there. Most repositories, certainly around
academia, tend to be fully open, so anyone can access what is
deposited.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember this as you may not want, or be able to,
make your code fully open to all (although we encourage you to where
possible). However, there are repositories out there that have different
levels of access. For example the <a href="https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/" class="external-link">UK Data Service repository</a> has
three levels of access, open, safeguarded (have to sign the End User
Licence), and controlled (have to apply for access with criteria set by
data provider), however, currently the UK Data Service does not hold
code.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that there are different types of
repositories, some are purely for publications (such as the <a href="https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/" class="external-link">White Rose Research Online
repository</a>, whereas others are data focused e.g. <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/" class="external-link">Harvard Dataverse</a>).</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>As we’ve just seen not all repositories are created equal, some are
not just repositories, others aren’t technically repositories at all.
This means you should put some thought into which repository you are
going to use to deposit your code.</p>

<p>As there are many different repositories out there, picking a
suitable one for your code is an important task. You may know the
repository that you wish to use already, or you may want to find a
suitable subject specific repository. Both <a href="http://re3data.org" class="external-link">re3data</a> and <a href="http://fairsharing.org" class="external-link">FAIRsharing</a> hold a directory of
repositories that can be browsed, searched, and filtered to help you
find the most suitable repository for your needs.</p>

quickly be able to answer some of the questions listed above.</p>
<p>Our own guidance is that you should look for a subject or data
specific repository first, and if nothing is suitable or has the
functionality required, then you should use ORDA (The University of
Sheffield institutional repository).</p>

<p>Maybe! But also probably not. The main issue is that they are
different things really, or at least help and aid in different ways, but
use a lot of the same vocabulary. While a package will most likely make
it much easier for people to use you work (a simple install command), it
often doesn’t make it more citeable.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>For example, the main repository of Python packages the Python
Package Index or <a href="http://pypi.org" class="external-link">PyPI</a>, holds over half a
million projects, but does not mint a DOI for these projects. However,
recently, all R packages on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" class="external-link">CRAN</a> have been attributed a DOI.
Now of course there’s differences there in how packages are regulated
but it’s a good step forward and giving the creators of packages the
recognition they deserve.</p>
<p>This is also the issue with using just GitHub, while it holds all
your work, and enables people to access, read, use, and reuse your work,
it also does not mint DOIs, as it’s main function is to aid in version
control and allow a team to work on the same project at once, it is not
so concerned with the long term storage or archiving of work (unlike
other repositories), and, while nothing has happened yet, it’s worth
remembering that GitHub is owned by Microsoft and could technically
change at any time.</p>
<p>There is a lot more about packages in the FAIR<sup>2</sup>4RS
component on this, including how to create and publish your own,
including the automation of the publication.</p>
<p>The other issue with these being the same but different is that it is
normally good practice to only put your work in one repository, however,
it might be beneficial in this instance to have a package created for
easy download, and your work in a repository that grants a DOI for
better citation. (Note: it’s very bad practice to gain more than one DOI
for an output).</p>

</figure><p>There’s a few other bits of interest in this image as well. First you
can see that if a GitHub repo has been imported by another user if
doesn’t let you create another deposit for it (remember this would mint
another DOI for the same output), and this is across all instances of
Figshare, for example that one is in the main Figshare.com instance.
There is also a simple option that you can see there that allows
automated updates of your GitHub repositories to be pulled into ORDA,
the slider between the repo name and last modified date.</p>
<p>However that automation is reliant of the use of a GitHub Action,
which might not be the best approach for yourself (<a href="https://github.com/figshare/github-upload-action" class="external-link">guidance on the
Action</a>).</p>
<p>Alternatively you could use Figshare’s API to automate the creation
of a new version. There’s a much more detailed description and example
of how to do this in the Packages component of this course.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, if you are thinking of having both a package in a
repository, and depositing somewhere else to get a DOI, this is probably
something you should certainly consider to ensure that there are not
different versions of your work in different places.</p>

<p>Simply put metadata is data about data (hence meta). This might not
be that helpful a description however, but is necessary as it holds true
across all types of meta data. If we continue with the idea of
depositing your code in a repository as we saw in the previous episode
it becomes much clearer. The metadata is the data that’s on the deposit
‘front’ page so to speak. It is there to inform anyone who comes across
the deposit what they have found without having to dive too far into the
actual data or code.</p>

<p>Of course, however, it might be more interesting to see some bad
metadata as it’s probably more effective in showing how important
metatdata can be.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/ORDA_bad_metadata_example.png" alt="A screenshot showing a deposit in ORDA with bad metadata" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">“Image 1 - ORDA example of bad metadata”</div>
</figure><p>As you can see there, there’s some information about the deposit, but
it’s probably not nearly enough for anyone to know what it really is, or
if it’s useful to them. This code <em>could</em> be perfect for someone
to use, or adapt, but they wouldn’t know without having to do a lot of
work to figure this out. There is a link to the github repository, but
that’s probably not got any more information in it, and still as we’ve
seen that means someone wouldn’t be able to as reference you work. (N.B.
There’s no DOI on that deposit as it’s just a draft, we wouldn’t really
accept a deposit in ORDA that had so little information, another good
reason to think about metadata as ORDA isn’t an outlier in this
regard).</p>
<p>But there is a README there, which asks the question;</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>It’s a good question, and one I’m sure people would argue over as
they have different views on it, technically, metadata is for finding
software while documentation, including READMEs, are for understanding
it. However, the thing that actually matters is you should probably have
a README, and metadata, and other documentation as well. READMEs and
other documentation (comments etc.) should be created early and updated
as you go along, with potentially metadata being thought of later in the
life cycle. However, a good README may directly feed into you metadata.
If you copy and paste elements, there’s no problem there, in fact it can
be beneficial, it saves you time, and makes sure everything lines up and
states the same things.</p>
<p>It might be worth thinking of metadata as the very overarching
information, a README goes into more detail but covers the whole
software/project, and comments etc. are much more fine grained to where
they reside.</p>

<p>It’s best when thinking about creating metadata that you think of
human users. It’s also really good to think of yourself as one of these
users, either yourself a few years ago, when you might have known less
of the area and might not have known exactly you were looking for, or
yourself in a few years, when you’ve most likely forgotten everything
about this code, why you made it, and what exactly it does.</p>
<p>However you also get a bit more findablility for free by creating
metadata,as these fields are often used and standardised for machine
readability as well.</p>

<p>Can you pick out the good (and bad) elements of metadata in the above

<li>Date created</li>
<li>Item type</li>
<li>A clear name</li>

<p>There’s also the language that it is written in, both in the
description and the keywords. The first three listed, names, version,
and date, would all fall under what was previously referred to as
provenance. As you can see a lot of these are fields in a deposit to a
repository, which makes it easier, but if you are going a different
route could be very easy to miss out. It is also important that you keep
these up to date if they change, or just take that bit of time to
consider, it’s not good form to miss someone off an author list, and
this applies to software author list as well.</p>

<p>As just seen, a repository, even a GitHub repository will has fields
for a some of this information and these will be implementing a
standard, but if you are doing something else, you might need to
consider using a standard for you metadata. Some example are
schema.org’s <a href="https://schema.org/SoftwareApplication" class="external-link">SoftwareApplication</a>
type, and <a href="https://codemeta.github.io/" class="external-link">CodeMeta</a>. These just
help tools to work with your metadata by having a set standard, for
example if you created it now what would you call your author list
field, author_list, authorList, developer, developers, writer, creator,
coders etc. so you can see this could get out of hand quickly.</p>
<p>You’ll have come across standards before of course, when you download
citations of papers for your reference manager software;</p>

<p>If we go back to the first thing that was stated in this module
<em>The code that you write is important. No matter the size, style, or
language it is an integral part of the research that it is part of, or
of course sometimes it is the main output of the research project.</em>,
which also applies to code that other people write. That’s why it’s
important to know that you can (and should) cite people’s code you use,
and how to make it so people can cite yours.</p>

<!--- ask about any other elements, the importance of other outputs, not just papers ---><p><a href="https://sfdora.org/" class="external-link">DORA</a>, The Declaration on Research
Assessment, sets out to improve the ways in which the outputs of
scholarly research are evaluated, essentially moving away from the
impact factor of journals that you publish in (which was originally
created to help librarians decide which journals to subscribe to, not
anything to do with academic success). The University of Sheffield is a
signatory of this declaration.</p>
<p>We’re also seeing a continued movement from funders to make open and
available all aspects of researcher projects as the importance and cost
of all elements are more truly recognised, we’ve seen this with data
with a lot of funders requiring (where suitable) to be made open, and
we’re also seeing this with code. Making things open is great, reusing
work is also great, ensuring people get the recognistion they deserve
from their work is essential (and in most cases a legal necessity, see
licence section, or software Terms and Conditions e.g. <a href="https://www.sas.com/en_gb/legal/editorial-guidelines.html" class="external-link">SAS</a>).</p>
<p>There’s also been some movement with the REF as well, with more types
of outputs being eligible to be returned, and if we thing about impact
case studies, a useful piece of software could easily have good impact.
There’s also movements like the <a href="https://hidden-ref.org/the-5-percent-manifesto/" class="external-link">Hidden REF</a>
whose objective is to gain recognistion for all people who contribute to
research, and are also wanting institutions to pledge to having 5% of
their REF returns be non-traditional research outputs (anything that’s
not a journal paper).</p>
<p>These are also all good reasons not to simply cite the associated
paper, if there even is one.</p>

<p>Citation of software if of course different to a standard journal
article. Normally there is one version of an article and nothing that
can really ‘break’ with them, this is not true of software. Also, a
paper tends to have all the information you need to cite it correctly
quite clearly there for you, again this often isn’t the case for
software.</p>

<p>Think what people might need to know from a citation to be able to
reproduce a piece of research</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Some of the main things to know about the software used that would be
integral to being able to reproduce the outputs would be;</p>
<ul>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Authors</li>
<li>Version used</li>
<li>Where to find the software</li>
<li>How to access the code (if different to the above, and
available)</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two, while clear should be part of a citation, might not be
immediate when thinking about reproducablity, but if you think that they
can sometimes act as a kind of ‘primary key’ to help people know they’re
working with the right software (see last episode and naming
things).</p>
<p>The bottom three you can see would be needed to be certain you can
reproduce the work as best as possible. We know that many changes can
happen between versions, some big changes, some small changes that could
have knock on affects to how everything works. Of course where to find
the software goes back to our first episode, and having a solid pointer
to the code can be solved by getting a DOI for your work (you should of
course not mint a DOI for other people’s work, and you might just have
to cite the best link available).</p>
<p><code>CITATION.cff</code> are designed to pull everything you or
others need in one place. Similar to README, or LICENCE files, they are
top level files that contain in a standardised fashion all the
information required.</p>
<p>This is an example of a <code>CITATION.cff</code> file (the one for
this module):</p>
<p><code> This CITATION.cff file was generated with cffinit. Visit <a href="https://bit.ly/cffinit" class="external-link uri">https://bit.ly/cffinit</a> to

abstract: &gt;- While putting your software online certainly helps it
satisfy the FAIR principles, simply doing so might not be enough for
other researchers to actually find and utilise what you’ve put out
there.</p>
<p>It’s important to know the benefits and issues with where you store
and publish your data, and to make the most of the tools these platforms
provide, such as Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). It’s also important
to know best practice for how to increase the visibility and citability
of your work in cases where your chosen platform lacks these
features.</p>
<p>This course will introduce and explore worked examples of elements
that you should consider when publishing your software, which will help
you easily reference your work, and also help make it more findable and
reusable by others.</p>

<p>As you can see this has all the relevant metadata needed for full
citation, and you can see where it was created. This has also been
updated manually as well when things have changed, but there’s lots of
places you can see the fields needed and the style for them to be in if
you have a quick search.</p>
<p>If this is inside a GitHub repo, then on the right hand side you will
be able to get the citiation text, or one to be imported into a
reference manager, via a BibTeX file.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/github_citation_example.png" alt="A screenshot showing the options shown when clicking on the 'Cite this repository' in GitHub." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">“Image 1 - GitHub citiation outputs”</div>

correct information to cite other people’s work.</p>

<p>Not just GitHub makes use of CITATION.cff files, however, not
everywhere uses them either. As previously mentioned you can link your
GitHub repos to ORDA, the university repository, and ORDA has an easy
way of creating citations as well.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/ORAD_citation_example.png" alt="A screenshot showing the a citiation created by ORDA." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">“Image 2 - ORDA citiation creation”</div>
</figure><p>However, the two citations that we’ve just seen for the same output
is not the same. The issues comes with that Figshare (that ORDA is an
instance of), does not look in the <code>CITATION.cff</code> file, but
creates one from the metadata that is entered for the deposit. In this
example the author list is different as I’ve entered all authors into
the <code>CITATION.cff</code> file, but have not edited this in ORDA.
It’s easy to add these, but it repetition of work, which isn’t ideal,
but it’s important to try and get everything the same where possible.
You don’t know where your work may end up once it’s been made open, so
controlling what you can to start with really improves the provenance
being kept with it, and the ability of people to find the original
repository. The <code>CITATION.cff</code> file should also always be
kept with your work if it does get shared on wards and helps to this end
as well.</p>
