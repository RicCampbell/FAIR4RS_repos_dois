## Course summary

While putting your software online certainly helps it satisfy the FAIR principles, simply doing so might not be enough for other researchers to actually find and utilise what you’ve put out there.

It’s important to know the benefits and issues with where you store and publish your data, and to make the most of the tools these platforms provide, such as Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). It’s also important to know best practice for how to increase the visibility and citability of your work in cases where your chosen platform lacks these features.

This part of the course will introduce and explore worked examples of elements that you should consider when publishing your software, which will help you easily reference your work, and also help make it more findable and reusable by others.


## Course overview

- DOIs
    - What are they, how do they work and how do I get one?
- Repositories (both software and non-software versions).
    - What do they allow you and others to do and how to pick one
- Metadata
    - Why it’s important
    - Best practice and good examples
- Citation
    - You (probably) already know how to do this (sort of)
    - What do you want them to access? (static vs dynamic work).


## Data Sets

There is no requirement to have any data or code to work through this module. Any examples or exercises can be done with either empty files or without any at all. It would be better for learning outcomes, and help to get the best from the material, if you have an example of code/software to think about while working through.

The repo of these materials may be used if needed [Software dissemination and impact](https://github.com/RicCampbell/FAIR4RS_repos_dois/tree/main)

## Software Setup

### Details

No specific software will be required for this lesson, however please make sure you can access your account on the University of Sheffield's institutional repository [ORDA](https://orda.shef.ac.uk), having a GItHub account and a ready made repository would also be benificial.
