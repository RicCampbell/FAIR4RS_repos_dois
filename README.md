# Software dissemination and impact

## Course Description:
While putting your software online certainly helps it satisfy the FAIR principles, simply doing so might not be enough for other researchers to actually find and utilise what you’ve put out there.

It’s important to know the benefits and issues with where you store and publish your data, and to make the most of the tools these platforms provide, such as Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). It’s also important to know best practice for how to increase the visibility and citability of your work in cases where your chosen platform lacks these features.

This course will introduce and explore worked examples of elements that you should consider when publishing your software, which will help you easily reference your work, and also help make it more findable and reusable by others.

## Course overview

- DOIs
    - What are they, how do they work and how do I get one?
- Repositories (both software and non-software versions).
    - What do they allow you and others to do and how to pick one
- Metadata
    - Why it’s important
    - Best practice and good examples
- Citation
    - You (probably) already know how to do this (sort of)
    - What do you want them to access? (static vs dynamic work).
